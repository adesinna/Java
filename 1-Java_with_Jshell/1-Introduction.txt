1. Printing a statement

    System.out.print("Hello World");
    System.out.print("Hello Shanana");

    # Note that
    - System.out.print("Hello", "World"); this won't work in Java
    - "" is for strings, '' cannot be used for strings


2. Variables
    You must specify the type of data type when declaring variables

   int myFirstNumber = 29;    # a variable called 29 which is an integer

   System.out.print(myFirstNumber);

   jshell> myFirstNumber = 45; # reassign, you dont need to declare type,
                               # but not allowed in
   myFirstNumber ==> 45

   jshell> System.out.print(myFirstNumber);


   int secondNumber = (8*8) + (0/7);

   This as a whole is called declaration, while the RHS is called expression

    int newNew = myFirstNumber + secondNumber; # newNew must be the format of the variable
