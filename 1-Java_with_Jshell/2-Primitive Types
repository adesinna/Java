There are eight primitive data types in Java

Numbers in Z fall into data types:
    - byte
    - short
    - int
    - long

Numbers in R fall into data types:
    - float
    - double

Single Character falls into data type:
    - char

Boolean Value falls into data type:

    - boolean

Let us delineate these

Integers:
    This are whole numbers, however they do have a range

    int myMinInt = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    myMinInt ==> -2147483648

    int myMaxInt = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    myMaxInt ==> 2147483647

    System.out.print("my max is = " + myMaxInt); # the plus allows you to print two kinds of data types, just like f'{}' in python

    System.out.print("The range is (" + Integer.MIN_VALUE + " to " + Integer.MAX_VALUE + ")" ); # space the to on both sides
